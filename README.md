## Cite country PFA

We are happy that you use your model and data for your research. When publishing your work in articles, working paper, 
presentations or elsewhere, please cite the model as 

[Tandetzki, J. and Honkomp, T. (2024). Country specific calculation of potential vegetation area](Citation.cff)

## Install country PFA

The package is developed and tested with Python 3 (python 3.8.9 and python 3.12.6) version on Windows.
Before proceeding, please ensure that Python is installed on your system. It can be downloaded and installed 
from [Python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-389/).

1. Clone the repository  
TODO replace GITLAB repo with GITHUB repo  
Begin by cloning the repository to your local machine using the following command: 
    >git clone https://git-dmz.thuenen.de/Tandetzki/potential_vegetation_area.git
   > 
2. Switch to the PNV directory  
Navigate into the PNV project folder on your local machine.
   >cd PFA
   >
3. Create a virtual environment  
It is recommended to set up a virtual environment for TiMBA to manage dependencies. The package is tested using Python >3.8.9 (3.8.10 and 3.9.7). With a newer Python version, we can not guarantee the full functionality of the package.
   Select the correct Python interpreter.   
   Show installed versions: 
   >py -0  
   >
   - If you have installed multiple versions of Python, activate the correct version using the py-Launcher.
   >py -3.8 -m venv venv 
   > 
   >py -3.12 -m venv venv 
   > 
   - If you are using only a single version of Python on your computer:
   >python -m venv venv
   >
4. Activate the virtual environment  
Enable the virtual environment to isolate PNV dependencies. 
   >venv\Scripts\activate
   > 
5. Install PNV requirements  
Install all required PNV dependencies listed in the requirements.txt file.
   >pip install -r requirements.txt
   >
6. Install PNV in the editable mode  
   >pip install -e .

If the following error occurs: "ERROR: File "setup.py" or "setup.cfg" not found."
you might need to update the pip version you use with: 
>python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip


### Doublecheck installation and test suite
The PFA package comes with a test suite to ensure its functionality.
Run the test suite to check the functionality of the package:

  > coverage run

or 
 > $python -m unittest discover -s test


To reduce the test suite running time, only the data for 6 classes are tested. The test suite results will not be saved.
The aggregated data are validated using the WDI land surface with a relative tolerance of 5%.  

The coverage report of the TiMBA model can be accessed using:
 > coverage report


## Use PFA modul 
For more information about the raw, preprocessed and output data refer to the readme written in each folder.  

```bash
.
`- data input
  `-- raw #data .tif files from **Bonannella et al. (2023) available at [zenodo](https://zenodo.org/records/7822868)
  `-- preprocessed #reform data to epsg.8857 coordinate system
  `-- outputs #shows worldmap.png data and pnv data for 6 (IUCN) and 20 (6K biome) different vegetation classes for different countries. 
 ```
The package generate output in the folder data and output. Output is provided for the data regarding country specific area 
processing (Excel and pkl and simple maps) and validation figures (comprehensive world maps with figures)

```bash
 `- data output
  `-- ...6 or 20_class_combined.xlsx # output data for all classes (6 or 20) and every country and scenario 
  `-- ...6 or 20_class_combined.pkl # same structure as Excel data
  `-- ...6 or 20_class_different_sheets.xlsx # output data for all classes (6 or 20) and every country and  every scenario on different Excel sheets
  `-- ...PNV processing.log # logging information and data
  `-- biome6k_hcl_rcp...._year.png # related .png file for every .tif file
  `-- ...test_test_output.png # test validation figure #Todo: rename of output?
  `-- PNV_world_map_6 or 20 classes_rcp26_45_85.png # comprehensive validation output
```

### Model settings
There are various setting options within the model. The user input allows for various settings to be configured. By 
default, there are 6 classes, and preprocessing is set to True. Preprocessing should remain True if the .tif files have 
not yet been processed into the desired coordinate system. In the first step, the processing of the TIF files takes place. 
Data is read and stored in the preprocessed directory. Additionally, the calculation of country-specific areas is performed 
depending on the class. The data is then stored in Excel and PKL files, as well as a simple world map in PNG format.

In the second step, the processed data is validated and visualized. This occurs in the toolbox. The final output of the 
package consists of various figures that allow for the validation of future potential forest areas under different RCPs.
Users can adapt model settings by changing entries in default_parameters.py.

#### PFA:
- A flag to process the required coordinate system (epsg.8857)
- A flag to change between the number of classes and biomes, respectively [default: 6 classes]
 
#### Toolbox:  
The toolbox offers a large range of settings to adapt the analysis to the user's needs:
- 'SELECT_PNV_CLASS': Allows to control the number of biome classes processed [default: 6 classes]
- 'SELECT_YEAR': Allows to control the selected year for which data will be plotted [options: 2013 to 2060]
- 'SELECT_RCP': List of selected rcp for which data will be plotted [options: 'rcp26', 'rcp45', 'rcp85']
- 'SELECT_AGG_LVL': Allows to control the selected aggregation level which will be used for spatial aggregation [options: 'continents', 'fao_regions', 'country']
- 'SELECT_ISO': Allows to control the selected country ISO code which data will be plotted [options: 'any ISO3-list', 'big_n', 'continent name']. 
    - 'any ISO3-list' Option shows all countries in the list of ISO3 codes (e.g., ['GER', 'FRA', 'SWE'] 
    - 'big_n' Option shows the countries with n-largest forest area (e.g., ['big_10'] or ['big_5'])
    - 'continent name' Option shows all countries within the selected continent (e.g. ['South America'] or ['Asia'])
- 'PAPER_FORMAT': Allows to control the fontsize in figures
- 'SAVE_FIGURE': Controls if the figures are saved in the output directory
- 'OUTPUT_NAME': Name of output file

## Extended model description
This model allows for further procession of potential vegetation area data published by Bonannella et al (2023). The data 
encompass different classes of global biomes 6000 at a cross-spatial level. The historical data (1979-2013) from Bonannella 
et al. were calibrated and projected under three different climate scenarios (RCP 2.6, RCP 4.5, and RCP 8.5) for the 
distribution of future biomes during the periods 2040-2060 and 2061-2080. We use this data as an example to create a model 
that processes the spatial resolution TIF files and subsequently outputs the results by country for each biome category. 

The model outputs includes country-specific data for each climate-scenario, global maps as PNG files, and a comprehensive 
toolbox for visualizing changes in potential vegetation area across the various periods and climate scenarios. This visualization 
distinguishes between aggregated data and individual country data. Additionally, it is possible to compare potential vegetation 
areas with World Bank country land data, allowing for the interpretation and validation of the results. 

The following figure depicts an example of global analyses obtained with 6 classes and 3 RCPs in 2050 (default_parameters.py).
Further, the following function parameters were used:
> pnv_analysis.pnv_world_map(fig_option='bar_chart', winkel_reproject=False, dissolve_map_regions=True)

of forest-related PNV data [10Â³ ha] in the respective region for the selected RCPs. The background map depicts the potential land cover share [%] where forest-related PNV classes could be established in 2050 in the scenario RCP2.6.
