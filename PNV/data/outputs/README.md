# Data output 

In the Data Output under PNV, '.png' files are generated
that transform the data from Bonanella et al. (2023)
into wolrd maps. Depending on the user`s input selection, the maps 
display either 20 different biome vegetation classes 

*('NA', 'Cold deciduous forest', 'Cold evergreen needleleaf forest', 'Cool evergreen needleleaf forest',
    'Cool mixed forest', 'Cool temperate rainforest', 'Desert', 'Erect dwarf shrub tundra',
    'Graminoid and forb tundra', 'Low and high shrub tundra', 'Prostrate dwarf shrub tundra',
    'Steppe', 'Temperate deciduous broadleaf forest', 'Temperate evergreen needleleaf open woodland',
    'Temperate sclerophyll woodland and shrubland', 'Tropical deciduous broadleaf forest and woodland',
    'Tropical evergreen broadleaf forest', 'Tropical savanna', 'Tropical semi-evergreen broadleaf forest',
    'Warm-temperate evergreen broadleaf and mixed forest', 'Xerophytic woods/scrub')*

or 6 biome classes 

*('NA', 'Tropical-subtropical forest biome', 'Temperate-boreal forests and woodlands biome',
    'Shrublands and shrubby woodland biome', 'Savannas ans grassland biomes', 'Desert and semi desert biomes',
    'polar/alpine (cryogenic) biome')* . 

These maps can represent either calibrated historical values from 1979-2913 or simulated future values for RCP 2.6, 
4.5, and 8.5 for the periods 2040-2060 and 2061-2080. The "biome6k..." refers to the 20 vegetation classes, while 
"iucn..." denoted the 6 biome 
classes.
