# Data input raw

The Data input raw folder contains the datasets provided by Bonanella et al. (2023), 
available through https://zenodo.org/records/7822868, organized into 20 biome classes and 6 biome classes. 
Processing additional input files (e.g., probability files from Bonanella et al. (2023)) will require modifications
to the recent Python package.
