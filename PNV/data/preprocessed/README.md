# Data input preprocessed

In this folder, input data is read and preproccessed, ensuring that the data is in the correct coordinate system. 
The package evaluates global vegetation areas for all countries. Through the User_input, it can be specified whether the
preprocessing step is necessary or if the input data has already been preprocessed.
